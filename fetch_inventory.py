# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Script: fetch_inventory.py
#
# Description:
#     This script connects to the Meraki Dashboard API to fetch a complete
#     list of devices for a specified organization. It is designed to be
#     user-friendly by automatically discovering the organization ID(s)
#     associated with the provided API key.
#
# Key Features:
#     - Dynamically fetches all accessible organizations.
#     - If only one organization is found, it is selected automatically.
#     - If multiple organizations are found, it prompts the user to select one.
#     - Saves the final device list as 'device_inventory.json' in the same
#       directory, making it ready for use by correlation scripts.
#
# Prerequisites:
#     - Python 3
#     - Required libraries: 'requests', 'python-dotenv'
#       (Install with: pip install requests python-dotenv)
#     - A '.env' file in the same directory as this script.
#
# .env File Configuration:
#     The .env file must contain the following key:
#     MERAKI_API_KEY="your_meraki_api_key_here"
#
# Usage:
#     Run the script from the command line:
#     python fetch_inventory.py
#
# Output:
#     A JSON file named 'device_inventory.json' containing the raw device
#     data from the Meraki API.
